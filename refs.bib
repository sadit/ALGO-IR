abstract="Consider the simple matrix A on the left in Figure 1.1. Many of its entries are zero (and so are omitted). This is an example of a sparse matrix. The problem we are interested in is that of solving linear systems of equations Ax{\thinspace}={\thinspace}b, where the square sparse matrix A and the vector b are given and the solution vector x is required. Such systems arise in a huge range of practical applications, including in areas as diverse as quantum chemistry, computer graphics, computational fluid dynamics, power networks, machine learning, and optimization. The list is endless and constantly growing, together with the sizes of the systems. For efficiency and to enable large systems to be solved, the sparsity of A must be exploited and operations with the zero entries avoided. To achieve this, sophisticated algorithms are required.",

abstract = {The performance of sequential search can be enhanced by the use of heuristics that move elements closer to the front of the list as they are found. Previous analyses have characterized the performance of such heuristics probabilistically. In this article, we use amortization to analyze the heuristics in a worst-case sense; the relative merit of the heuristics in this analysis is different in the probabilistic analyses. Experiments show that the behavior of the heuristics on real data is more closely described by the amortized analyses than by the probabilistic analyses.},

abstract = {Consider the problem of computing the intersection of k sorted sets. In the comparison model, we prove a new lower bound which depends on the non-deterministic complexity of the instance, and implies that the algorithm of Demaine, L\'{o}pez-Ortiz and Munro [2] is usually optimal in this "adaptive" sense. We extend the lower bound and the algorithm to the t-Threshold Problem, which consists in finding the elements which are in at least t of the k sets. These problems are motivated by boolean queries in text database systems.},
